# TicTacToe Game
Cool Python TicTacToe game.
To start, dowload TicTacToe.py, which is attached to this project. You will need python installed on your computer, so if you do not, go to this link (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Open up the file in python and run the code. You will be able to play TicTacToe by pressing on any of the squares that are part of the 3x3 grid. Once a player wins, or it is a  tie, a popup will show up, giving you the result of the game.

To clear the board and start a new game, press on the "Ok" selection on the winning prompt.
